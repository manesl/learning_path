LEARNING PATH

Our Vision
Create a recommendation web-app which suggests leaning paths to users based on their knowledge level and most up-votes.

Why we did it?
In the current pandemic situation, we relied more on online education to learn, study, get remote classess. But it has its own loopholes. Often, we observed that many young motivated minds are not able to pursue anything of their interest since the resources available online are not structured properly or they are too many confusing them to in deciding which one must be picked first.
A person who has just started with a particular topic, would naturally be overwhelmed and terrified if bombarded with so many videos, datasheets, blogs, books, etc. of varying levels of understanding.

Our solution - 
We made a web app to recommend a learning path to be adopted by the user in order to get a firm grasp of the course they want to learn right from basics to being an expert.
Based on their existing level of understanding of a particular topic, we recommend them books, website links, data-sheets, etc. that they should refer to, in such an order so that they can understand the topic in the most effective and easy manner. Making their learning process smooth. All the recommendation-learning paths can come from students who already learnt that technology or professors in that field of study. 

Challenges we faced - 
Integrating the web app with the database
Making a model based on up-vote counts

Who are we?
Essentially a diverse team of students from UC and India, we love to work on projects that helps make people's lives easier and leaves a good impact in this world.
