LEARNING PATH

Our Vision
Create a recommendation web-app which suggests leaning paths to users based on their knowledge level and most up-votes.

Why we did it?
In the current scenario we are in,we are dependent on online education to learn about something new. But it has its own loopholes. Often, we observed that many young motivated minds are not able to pursue anything of their interest since the resources available online are not structured properly.
A person who has just started with a particular topic,would naturally be overwhelmed and terrified if bombarded with so many videos,data-sheets,blogs,books,etc. of varying levels of understanding and grasp required on the subject.

Our solution - 
We made a web app to recommend a learning path to be adopted by the user in order to get a firm grasp of the course they want to learn.
Based on their existing level of understanding of a particular topic,we recommend them books,website links,data-sheets,etc. that they should refer to, in such an order so that they can understand the topic in the most effective and easy manner.

Challenges we faced - 
Integrating the web app with the database
Making a model based on up-vote counts

Who are we?
Essentially a diverse team of students from UC and India,we love to work on projects that helps make people's lives easier and leaves a good impact in this world.
